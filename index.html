		<h1>Transverse and longitual waves</h1>
		<p>
			Transverse and longitudinal waves are two fundamental types of mechanical waves that propagate through a medium, such as a solid, liquid, or gas.
			The distinction between them is based on the direction of particle oscillation relative to the direction of wave propagation.
		</p>
		<h2>Transverse waves</h2>
		<p>In transverse waves, the particles of the medium vibrate perpendicular to the direction of the wave.<br>
		Examples: Light waves, electromagnetic waves, and seismic S-waves (secondary or shear waves)</p>
		<h2>Longitudal waves</h2>
		<p>In longitudinal waves, the particles of the medium vibrate parallel to the direction of the wave.<br>
		Examples: Sound waves and seismic P-waves (primary or compressional waves) are examples of longitudinal waves.</p>
		<h1>Wave properties</h1>
		<h2>Frequency and period</h2>
		<p>
			Frequency&nbsp;(f) is the number of cycles of a wave occuring in one second.
			It's measured in Hertz&nbsp;(Hz). In sound, perceive this as a change of the sound's pitch.
			The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch.
			If the frequency doubles, we will hear the sound an octave higher.<br>
			Period&nbsp;(T) is inversed frequency - it describes length of one period, in seconds (s).
			The longer the period, the lower the pitch.
		</p>
		<h2>Amplitude</h2>
		<p>
			Amplitude&nbsp;(A) is the largest displacement of the particles from the rest position.
			In sound perceive that as a change of the sound's loudness. The larger the amplitude, the louder the sound. It is measured in decibels&nbsp;(dB),
			however different units describing displacement or pressure can be used for other types of waves.
		</p>
		<h2>Wavelength</h2>
		<p>
			Wavelength&nbsp;(Î») describes the distance between two corresponding points of a consecutive cycles. It is measured in meters&nbsp;(m).
			It is directly proportional to the period and inversely proportional to frequency.
		</p>
		<h2>Wave speed</h2>
		<p>
			Wave speed&nbsp;(v) describes the speed at which a wave travels through a medium. It is measured in meters per second&nbsp;(m/s) and is related to the medium's properties.<br>
			An interesting behavior may be observed when we throw a stone on thin ice - we hear not one, but three sound. This is because sound is the slowest when travelling through air, faster when in water and the fastest in ice.
		</p>
		<h1>Sound, in detail</h1>
		<h2>How is sound created?</h2>
		<p>Sound is nothing else than air vibrating and changing pressure. Any vibrating object makes air vibrate as well and the energy is transferred to our ears, where we receive it.<br></p>
		<h2>Sound timbre</h2>
		<p>We all know that even sounds of the same pitch can be perceived as different. This is caused by different timbres of these sounds.<br>
		Each sound consists of a base frequency and it's multiples. Depending on which frequency is dominant and how loud or quiet are the remeaning frequencies, we perceive a different timbre. This makes us able to i.e. distinguish instruments by sound.<br>
		In music, we can change timbre by changing playing technique, for example by changing bowing technique on strings or by applying a mute on brass.</p>
		<h2>Audible range</h2>
		<p>The term "audible range" refers to the range of frequencies that can be heard by the average human ear. The typical human hearing range is from 20&nbsp;Hz to 20,000&nbsp;Hz, although this range can vary from person to person, especially with age.
		The lower limit of 20&nbsp;Hz represents the lowest frequencies that most people can perceive as sound, while the upper limit of 20,000&nbsp;Hz represents the highest frequencies that are audible.<br>
		Sound waves with frequencies below the audible range are called infrasound, while those above the audible range are called ultrasound. Different animals have different audible ranges, and most species can hear sounds at frequencies beyond the human range.</p>
		<h2>Experiments with sound</h2>
		<p>Below, we present a little simulation allowing you to discover sound's properties and their relation to the amplitude and frequency of its harmonic components.</p>
    <p>The simulation shows amplitude/time relation in the upper part, and amplitude/frequency relation at the current moment. (What sine base-waves have to be added up to make sound that is playint at particular moment)</p>
    <p>We highly encourage you to go through the example sound files and try to see a relation between sound's pitch/timbre and frequencies' amplitude. Our simulations offers a few controls: one allowing you to filter out some frequency ranges, another one to change time-length of the window (how many seconds it takes a sample to travel from right to left), y-scale control (to make visualisation visible with quiet sounds) and file chooser. In the final part of the article, you can find notes regarding the experiments.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>(1) With Electric Piano, we can see that the relation between sound's pitch and it's loudest frequency is not linear. The soundfile contains six sounds, each an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave">octave</a> higher than previous. If you're careful enough, you can see that the loudest frequency is around two times larger each time. In fact, a sound octave higher than sound with frequency f1, has frequency equal <u>exactly</u> 2 * f1. (This is not perfectly visible, due to imperfect recording device and sound generated by hitting piano keys).</p>
  <p>(2) With Chromatic Scale, we can see how frequency changes in a chromatic scale. A fun fact: ratio between the frequencies of every two consecutive notes played in the audio file is (2 to the power (1/12)). Why? We've just observed that a ratio of frequencies of sounds differing in pitch by an octave is equal 2, and thus, we can deduce that a similar relation exists for other change in pitch - just the ratio is different. An octave contains exactly 12 consecutive notes of a chromatic scale. And the ration between each two notes has to be the same (as we've noticed), and thus the ratio (let's call it r) to the power of 12 is equal 2. And hence we get<br> r = 2^(1/12).</p>
  <p>(3) With Song Wodospady and Spectre, we can have some fun trying out removing different frequencies to both hear and see the results. Some interesting presets would be for example "2000-3000" or "0-1000" or "0-500, 2000-3000" for Song Wodospady (without quotation marks of course) and removing different ranges (at the same time pitches) from Spectre. (You can change filtered ranges of frequncies while audio is playing, just hit enter, to apply the changes)</p>
  <p>(4) With Whistle (being whistle of one of the article's creators btw.) you can observe, that human whistle is almost a pure sine wave, as almost exclusively one frequency is active.</p>
  <p>(5) With Two Together you can see that two sounds playing together look just as if we put one sound's visuals on top of other's. That leads to a conclusion - when we have two sounds, they simply add up!</p>
  <p>(6) We can observe another amazing fact in (5). The sounds base frequency (the lowest one) is repeated (but with lower amplitudes) on it's iteger multiples (f, 2f, 3f, ... ). This phenomena origins from some frequencies "resonating well" with the main one and other not so well. Thus, some frequencies die out very quickly and only integer multiples of the base frequency persist. These integer multiples of base frequency are known in music and physics as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtone">overtones</a>.</p>
